Mail::Sort is yet another module intended to enable the writing of
mail filters in the style of procmail(1). It was written when I
realized that the previous entries (Mail::Audit(3) and
Mail::Procmail(3)), while trying to emphasize elegance and brevity,
sacrificed a good deal of procmail's flexibility and power.

First and foremost, both of these existing modules only allow for
matching a single header at a time, throwing away procmail's TO_
feature (or any equivalent way of using a non-trivial regexp to match
a header tag). This really hurts when you try to match mailing lists
and spam list headers. Second, while I sympathize with the choice of
procedural interface with global variables in Mail::Procmail (way too
much of Perl code out there uses object-oriented syntax for no good
reason whatsoever), in the present case it means that the message
cannot be modified and then fed into another instance of the filter,
again a limitation in comparison to procmail.

Mail::Sort is meant to end the history of this particular area by
matching procmail's features 1-1.
